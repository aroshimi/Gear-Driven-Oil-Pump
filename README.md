# Gear-Driven Oil Pump

Driven by a passion for mechanical design and hands-on engineering, I recently completed my fourth personal project: a fully functional gear-driven oil pump. This challenge allowed me to merge theoretical knowledge with practical application, focusing on precision gear systems and efficient fluid displacement.

## Overview

This project explores the development of a gear-driven oil pump, a critical component in lubrication systems for engines and machinery. It reflects my progress in mechanical design and emphasizes the integration of CAD tools, fluid dynamics, and materials science. From early concept to detailed simulation and prototype testing, this project strengthened my design process and problem-solving skills.
